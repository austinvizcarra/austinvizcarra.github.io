    <h1> Hello World! </h1>
  
    <h2> A Place I Would like to visit </h2>
  
       <p> If I could, I would visit Ireland. I have heard that they have a really
       captivating landscape, and the residents are homely. On my Grandmother's side of 
       the family, there is a family crest and a castle with her last name in Ireland. </p>
    
    <h2> A Person I Admire </h2>
    
       <p> I admire Richard the Lionheart. Not only did he retake the Crusader States  
        from the Saracens in the Third Crusade, but he managed to defeat the then 
        "invincible" Saladin. </p> 
        
    <h2> Favorite Fruits </h2> 
    
       <ul> Apple 
            Lemon
            Pineapple
            Starfruit
            Dragonfruit </ul>
            
    <h2> Favorite Presidents </h2> 
        <ol> 
             <li>Theodore Roosevelt</li>
